Shell Company is a Factrio mod that improves vulcanus exports for artillery shells,
Hopefully fixing the age old problem of Space Age increasing the difficulty of obtaining artillery shells while not giving much back.
Its just plain harder to get artillery compared to vanilla so this hopes to rebalance it while still keeping the planitary transport aspect.

There is also an expensive navuis recipe that uses a metric ton of steel for those who wish to have bases that are isolated from the cargo landing pad.
This recipe is objectively worse when compared to the vulcanus exports so don't worry about vulcanus production becoming obsolete.
